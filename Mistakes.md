1. **Not actually learning from problems**
	- Spending too little time
	- Only jumping to the solution and not figuring out how to come up with it on your own, etc.
2. **Focusing too much on speed**
	- You can take your time solving problems, you don't have to solve it within 10 minutes during practice
3. **Being super stuck on a problem**
	- It's fine to look at the editorial after really trying your best on a problem
4. **Not focusing on your weak points**
	- If you struggle with something, focus on that area and improve in it
5. **Not being consistent**
6. **Jumping to code too quickly** *!!!*
	- Think of the solution first and do not think in terms of implementing it just yet.
7. **Not looking for edge cases**
8. **Misreading problems** *!!!!*
