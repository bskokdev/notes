- You are practicing to get better at problem solving - train your brain as a muscle
	- **My goal should be to be able to come up with the solutions to the problems not just know them**
	- understand both solution and how I can come up with it again
	- understand how the editorial came up with that solution as well

## What to take from editorials
#### DO NOT MEMORIZE SOLUTIONS
1. How I could come up with the solution (thought process, steps, observation)
2. Common ideas, or alternative solutions
3. Common ways to attack the problem and how to think about it
	1. Simplifying the problem statement, etc.
4. **Try to teach the problem solution at a whiteboard or via notes**

## Ask yourself a lot of questions
- Why is this happening
- Why are we doing this
- Why is this output correct
- Why do I need this piece of information

## Exercise part
- Go a month without asking others for help (not only for codeforces)
	- All thinking is done by you
		- No ChatGPT, limited amount of editorials, etc.
- Surround yourself with the problem
	- Try out the obvious stuff, and then take time and **THINK**
	- **Thinking is what will make you better at this**
	- Become stuck and think, and work yourself through the problem
		- This way you will learn a new way of thinking and coming up with solutions to problems which are similar
		- Your brains learns the most when you can come up with something yourself, especially after a long period of time
